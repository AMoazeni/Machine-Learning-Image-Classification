Max Pooling provides resilience against shifter or rotated features. It also further distills Feature Maps (reduces size) while preserving spatial relationships of pixels. Removing unnecessary information also helps prevent overfitting. Read 'Evaluation of Pooling Operations in Convolutional Architectures for Object Recognition.pdf'.
